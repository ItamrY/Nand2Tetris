The Nand2Tetris course is a hands-on journey through computer science and engineering, where you build a complete computer system from the ground up.
Starting with basic logic gates, you design and implement a CPU, memory architecture, and a virtual machine, compilers and eventually creating an operating system and running programs on your custom-built computer.
The course integrates theory with practical coding projects, offering a deep understanding of how software and hardware work together.

Our final project is the "Jetpack Joyride" Game we created from Scratch (project 09)
